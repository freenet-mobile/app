# FAQ

### Are there plans of putting the app on F-Droid, Google Play Store?

For sure. We'll work to have it published both on F-Droid and Google Play Store.

### Will there ever be an iOS version? Is it even possible?

Apparently it's [technically possible](https://multi-os-engine.org/). We're not sure we'll focus our efforts on it right now.

### Wouldn't that be a huge battery drain? What about data-plan?

The app is pre-configured to keep battery and network data usage to a minimum. You can configure the app to avoid data-plan use as well.

### Can I use the app on my everyday phone?

Yes, you can. Configure it to "preserve data", so it only connects on Wifi and "preserve battery" to run only when charging.

### Does it run on my Android X, Y, Z phone?

The application runs on Android Lollipop 5.1 and above. So any modern phone should work.

### What can I _do_ with it?

You can access and create content on Freenet. Access FMS Archive to see what the Freenet community is talking about.

### Will there be a "Mobile FMS"?

We'll work on Forums, File sharing, Blogging and Friend-to-friend support on the Mobile app.
