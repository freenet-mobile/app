Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication and publishing. It lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on forums, without fear of censorship.

Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attacks. Data is distributed automatically and redundant over the network. If used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect. To know more about Freenet look [here][about-freenet].

The Freenet Mobile app allows you to control Freenet with a single tap, configure it to your needs, and start up your node in a matter of seconds.

# FAQ

### Do I need to run a Freenet node?

The App itself runs a Freenet node. No need to have an external node installed and configured anywhere else.

### Wouldn't that be a huge battery drain? What about data-plan?

The app is pre-configured to keep battery and network data usage to a minimum. You can configure the app to avoid data-plan use as well.

### What about wearing out the phone's storage?

The app is pre-configured to store data on memory only. This way it avoid doing writes and wearing out the flash memory.

### Can I use the app on my everyday phone?

Yes, you can. Configure it to "preserve data", so it only connects on Wifi and "preserve battery" to run only when charging.

### Does it run on my Android X, Y, Z phone?

The application runs on Android Lollipop 5.1 and above. So any modern phone should work.

### What can I _do_ with it?

You can access and create content on Freenet. Access FMS Archive to see what the Freenet community is talking about.

### Will there be a "Mobile FMS"?

We'll work on Forums, File sharing, Blogging and Friend-to-friend support on the Mobile app.

### Are there plans of putting the app on Google Play Store?

Due to Google's Play Store actions against other apps we're not currently looking into publish the app on this platform.

### Will there ever be an iOS version? Is it even possible?

Apparently it's [technically possible](https://multi-os-engine.org/). We're not sure we'll focus our efforts on it right now.
